# Final Project
## HOW THE APPLICATION FUNCTIONS:

### Our computer application will allow a user to navigate the navbar from the top left corner of the website to the right. Each section in the navbar is defined as a PC part. If a user wants to return to the home page of the website, they will be able to click in the top left corner of the website, "PC-Merchant". A user will be able to register/create an account and login once they are done. If a user forgets their password, they will be able to reset their password. There is also a privacy section that a user can view if requested. Once the customer hits the submit button after selecting all of the PC components they desired, they will get an email sent to them with a list of their parts and their compatabilities. This helps to support the business function of purchasing compatable parts so that the user does not come across any complications when ordering.
